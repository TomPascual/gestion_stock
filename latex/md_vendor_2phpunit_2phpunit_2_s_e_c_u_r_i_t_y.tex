PHPUnit is a framework for writing as well as a command-\/line tool for running tests. Writing and running tests is a development-\/time activity. There is no reason why PHPUnit should be installed on a webserver and/or in a production environment.

{\bfseries{If you upload PHPUnit to a webserver then your deployment process is broken. On a more general note, if your {\ttfamily vendor} directory is publicly accessible on your webserver then your deployment process is also broken.}}

Please note that if you upload PHPUnit to a webserver "{}bad things"{} may happen. \href{https://thephp.cc/articles/phpunit-a-security-risk?ref=phpunit}{\texttt{ You have been warned.}}

PHPUnit is developed with a focus on development environments and the command-\/line. No specific testing or hardening with regard to using PHPUnit in an HTTP or web context or with untrusted input data is performed. PHPUnit might also contain functionality that intentionally exposes internal application data for debugging purposes.

If PHPUnit is used in a web application, the application developer is responsible for filtering inputs or escaping outputs as necessary and for verifying that the used functionality is safe for use within the intended context.

Vulnerabilities specific to the use outside a development context will be fixed as applicable, provided that the fix does not have an averse effect on the primary use case for development purposes.
